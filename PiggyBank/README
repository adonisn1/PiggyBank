Piggy Bank Implementation

For this implementation, we kept a similar design than the one specified.
 However, we did change the color scheme to a green-based palette, as we felt
 that green would represent the color of money.

We used green and red for accept/cancel buttons, as these two colors are
 complements, and therefore provide a clear distinction between their
 functionality.
